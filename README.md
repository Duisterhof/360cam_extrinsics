# Change the camera intrinsics

To change the intrinsics change the config/calibration.yaml file, currently only ds-none is supported. 

# Add more data

To add more data add more images in data/camX. Make sure the naming convention is consistent and the number of images is equal. 

# Change parameters

Might make an argument parser in the future, but for now you'll have to change the hyper parameters in main.py
